# Warehouse-Picker

## 1. Project Overview
#### Objective: 
Develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) system to optimize warehouse picking operations, minimizing opeatins, minimizing total picking time, avoid congestion, and improving energy effiency.

#### Key Features:
- Multi-agent coordination for simultaneous picking
- Congestion modeling to avoid collisions and optimize traffic flow.
- Energy efficiency reward to promote minimal and smooth movement.

#### Tools & Libraries:
- Pytorch (RL model training)
- Gymnasium (custom multi-agent warehouse enviroment)
- Numpy (State representation)
- Matplotlib / Pygame (visualization)
